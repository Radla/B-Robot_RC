# B-Robot_RC
 B-Robot Software with Radio Control Added

This software is based in the open source software from jjrobots. This software
runs on the Devia board version of the B-Robot. Radio control has been added,
and wifi control was removed. For radio control, an RC receiver with CPPM
is required. The CPPM pin is connected to the D13 pin, which is available on J17
of the Devia board. 5V and ground are required also, which can be picked up on
J16.
